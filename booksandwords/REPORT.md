1. I chose to use binary search tree. To get top-100 list I reorganized the tree by the amount of the words. I did use char arrays to read from file and to check if the letters matched Character.IsLetter. 
2. My implementation is not very correct because it is not ready yet.
3. It is not as efficient as it could be. I think that reorganization takes some time.
4. The most difficult thing was to find thing from the tree by using its position on the list/tree. I didn't figured it out yet, but I will try to make it work too, but the time run out. (If possible, I will sent an email, if I manage to make my implementation better, especially if my points aren't enough to pass the course).
5. I learned a lot about binary trees. And I also learned that in bigger projects the bugs can be basically anywhere, but they might come up in some other place.

EDIT:
En saanut booksandwords tehtävää testattua, että olisin saanut täytettyä compare taulukon, mutta muuten kaiken pitäisi nyt toimia.
